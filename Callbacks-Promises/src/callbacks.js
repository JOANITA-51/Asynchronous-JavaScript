/**
 * Callbacks are a great way to handle something after something else has been completed. By something here we mean a function execution. 
 * If we want to execute a function right after the return of some other function, then callbacks can be used.
 * Callbacks are primarily used while handling asynchronous operations like â€“ making an API request to the Google Maps,
 fetching/writing some data from/into a file, registering event listeners and related stuff. 
 * All the operations mentioned uses callbacks. This way once the data/error from the asynchronous operation is returned, 
 the callbacks are used to do something with that inside our code.
