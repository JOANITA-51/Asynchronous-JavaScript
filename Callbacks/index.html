    <p>Callbacks are a great way to handle something after something else has been completed. By something here we mean a function execution. If we want to execute a function right after the return of some other function, then callbacks can be used.</p>

    <p>Callbacks are primarily used while handling asynchronous operations like â€“ making an API request to the Google Maps, fetching/writing some data from/into a file, registering event listeners and related stuff. All the operations mentioned uses callbacks. This way once the data/error from the asynchronous operation is returned, the callbacks are used to do something with that inside our code.</p>
